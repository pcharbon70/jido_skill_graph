Summary of the lesson index pages: Elixir learning is typically staged from core syntax and data handling into runtime concerns and architecture patterns.
The basics track emphasizes data types, pattern matching, control flow, functions, modules, tooling, and documentation habits.
Intermediate topics shift toward process-oriented thinking and operational tasks, while advanced topics center on OTP structure and contracts.

Recommended progression through this graph is:
[[basics]] -> [[pattern-matching]] -> [[control-structures]] -> [[functions]] -> [[modules-and-docs]] -> [[enum-and-pipe]].
Then expand into project operation and resilience with [[mix-and-projects]], [[error-handling]], and [[concurrency]].
Finish with system design and quality practices in [[otp-supervision]], [[testing]], and [[typespecs-and-behaviours]].
