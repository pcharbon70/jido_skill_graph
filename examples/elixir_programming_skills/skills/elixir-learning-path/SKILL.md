Use this node as the entry point for learning Elixir as a connected set of concepts.

Start with [[basics]] to understand values, immutability, and interactive work in IEx.
Move to [[pattern-matching]] and [[control-structures]] so you can shape data and branch logic safely.
Then focus on [[functions]], [[modules-and-docs]], and [[enum-and-pipe]] to write composable, readable programs.

Once core syntax feels natural, add project workflow with [[mix-and-projects]], defensive coding in [[error-handling]], and concurrent design in [[concurrency]].
Finish by learning process lifecycle in [[otp-supervision]], quality practices in [[testing]], and interface contracts in [[typespecs-and-behaviours]].
