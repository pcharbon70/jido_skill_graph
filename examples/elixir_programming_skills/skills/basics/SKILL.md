Summary of the source lessons: begin with immutable values, then practice manipulating collections and strings in IEx until core operations feel automatic.
The lessons stress that maps, tuples, lists, binaries, and atoms each have different tradeoffs and should be chosen intentionally.
IEx helpers are positioned as a daily workflow tool for fast feedback and API discovery.

After these foundations, branch into [[pattern-matching]] for structural data extraction, [[control-structures]] for expression-driven flow, and [[functions]] for composition.
