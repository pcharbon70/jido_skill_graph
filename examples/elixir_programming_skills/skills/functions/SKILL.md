Summary of the lesson: distinguish anonymous and named functions, understand arity, and use pattern-matched clauses with guards to express intent.
The lesson also emphasizes private helpers and default arguments as readability tools, not substitutes for clear API design.

Keep data fundamentals from [[basics]] in mind while writing functions.
Organize public APIs with [[modules-and-docs]] and build transformation pipelines with [[enum-and-pipe]].
