# v0.1 Acceptance Criteria

This checklist defines what must be true before tagging `jido_skill_graph` v0.1.0.

## A. Core Package Scope

- `jido_skill_graph` can load skill files and build a directed graph snapshot.
- Cyclic links are supported.
- Node metadata can be listed without loading full body content.
- Node body can be read lazily on demand.

## B. Public API Surface

- API exists and is documented for:
  - `list_graphs/0`
  - `topology/2`
  - `list_nodes/2`
  - `get_node_meta/2`
  - `read_node_body/3`
  - `out_links/3`
  - `in_links/3`
  - `neighbors/3`
  - `search/3`

## C. Runtime Behavior

- Supervised mode is available through `child_spec/1`.
- Pure mode is available through `Builder.build/1`.
- Reload path uses atomic snapshot swap semantics.
- Failed reload cannot corrupt current active snapshot.

## D. Format Compatibility

- Supports `SKILL.md` and `skill.md` discovery.
- Supports optional YAML frontmatter.
- Supports wiki-link extraction (`[[node]]`).
- Supports frontmatter-declared typed links.

## E. Quality Gates

- Unit tests cover parser, link extraction, and normalization rules.
- Integration tests cover build, traversal, and reload semantics.
- Telemetry events and key measurements are documented.

## F. Ecosystem Integration

- Jido adapter can wire the core package into supervision tree.
- JidoAI can consume graph APIs without owning graph internals.
- Migration notes document replacement of direct legacy loading.

## G. Release Readiness

- Changelog drafted.
- Versioning policy documented.
- Minimum supported Elixir/Erlang versions documented.
- Example configuration for local development included.
